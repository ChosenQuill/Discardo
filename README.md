# The Discardo Competition

The discardo competition is a competition based of a Java lab (aka mini-project) created by CompSci teacher Mr. Bunn and [Dave Feinberg](https://sites.google.com/site/feinbergcompsci/home/hcs1/labs/discardolab).

Discardo itself is a simple single player card game. The goal of the origional Java lab is for students to have fun creating a simple to make yet thought-provoking to beat game. While its enjoyable for students to create their own game, students can also compete to see who can make the most efficient java discardo bot that can beat the game in the least amount of turns. This is the purpose of this repository/project. To make a fun and enjoyable competition while streamlining the process of providing information about the competition, submitting code, and viewing who is on top to a single multipage site.

While this repository/project is made primarily for Java teachers who want to provide their students with a fun competition, anyone can use this guide to host their own competition.

## How to host a competition
First, head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/SureDroid/Discardo/releases) and download both the backend jar file and web-files zip folder. The Jar file is the backend that processes all the code submissions and stores leaderboard information. The front-end is the website and is what everyone sees. At the moment, both files need to be hosted on the same machine.

There are multiple ways to host a website. The first thing you need is a domain. You can buy one from a domain registrar, or just use a temporary free domain/subdomain such as [freenom](https://www.freenom.com/en/index.html?lang=en). Next, we want to host our website. There are many ways to host a website. Since both the jar and the website need to be running on the server, the server will most likely be a hare operating system we most likely have to install our own hosting software. Since we are only serving a couple of static files, we don't need much.
